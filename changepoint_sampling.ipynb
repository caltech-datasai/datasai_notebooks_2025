The retina is exposed to constant light, but at some time between the start and end of the experience, the impinging light intensity changes. That is, for $0 \\le t < t_\\mathrm{switch}$, the retina is exposed to one light intensity, and for $t_\\mathrm{switch} \\le t \\le T$, it is exposed to another. The problem is that you do not know what $t_\\mathrm{switch}$ is, and you have to infer it. Your task is to construct a Bayesian model for this situation, complete with prior predictive checks.\n",
